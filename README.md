# Webflow Flower
This Webflow filter allows you to filter CMS items in Webflow using an embedded field.

## Installation
To add this, simply do the following:

1. Copy _all_ of the HTML code within webflow_filter_embedded.html - This means the code within both the <form> and <script> tags.
2. Create an embed block over the CMS Block to which you'd like to add searchability.
3. Paste the code into that embed block.
4. Update the function params to match.
5. Press Save, and publish.

## Feedback
If there are any issues with the code, please add an issue and I will correct it as soon as I can.
